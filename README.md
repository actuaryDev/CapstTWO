## Dataset1: Starting poker hands generated by me.
1. Starting with the simplest game, heads up, randomly generate starting hands for two players and define their hand equity.
2. Expand the randomly generated data to include stack sizes.
3. Further expand the randomly generated data to include simplified versions of actions 3-6 players.

## What I'll do to the data: 
* Implement decision trees based on hand equity.
* Classify hand values as the poker hand evolves (flop, turn, river).

## Dataset2: Expand on the poker hands use by Sam Andrews in his Capstone

## What I'll do to the data:
* Implement decision trees based on hand equity.
* Classify hand values as the poker hand evolves (flop, turn, river).
* Incorporate ICM chip valuation as the blinds in the tournament increase.

## Dataset3: HH Smithy Poker Hands
* [Link to HH Smithy](https://www.hhsmithy.com/buy/bulk)
* 530,000 Hands available for Heads Up $1-$2 NLH from 8/11/2017 (restart of online poker in NJ)
* I'll focus on poker hands from Heads Up $1-$2 NLH
* If successfully classifying at Heads Up $1-$2 NLH, expand to 3-6 player hands at $1-$2

## What I'll do to the data:
* Implement decision trees based on hand equity.
* Classify hand values as the poker hand evolves (flop, turn, river).
